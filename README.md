## 🌐 Why Do We Need a URL Shortener?

Long URLs are often:

- Hard to share or remember
- Unsuitable for social media or character-limited platforms
- Prone to breaking in emails or documents

**URL shorteners** solve this by:

- Converting long URLs into compact, shareable links
- Enabling click tracking, analytics etc
- Making links look clean and professional
